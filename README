The intent of this repository is to include a Dockerfile for running a
development/test instance of fichub.net. It falls far short of that currently.

Currently fichub.net's frontend depends on a few things to be fully functional:
	nginx
	uwsgi
	postgresql
	elasticsearch
	calibre
	alexandria

All but the final should be included in the built images currently.
fichub.net's code itself is not however, and alexandria is an entirely
separate can of worms to self-host. It may be best to mock it out until a
similar infra repository can be created for it.
