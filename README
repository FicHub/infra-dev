The intent of this repository is to include a Dockerfile for running a
development/test instance of FicHub.net.

Currently FicHub.net's prod environment depends on a few things to be fully
functional:
	nginx
	uwsgi
	postgresql
	elasticsearch
	calibre
	alexandria

All but the final should be included in the built images currently. Just run:
	./build.sh && docker-compose up
to build, run, and tail the logs. The local instance of FicHub will be
available on :59294 .

Alexandria is an entirely separate can of worms to self-host. It may be best
to mock it out until a similar infra repository can be created for it.
